4chan Preservation Order Confirmation (Report #{{REPORT_ID}})
Dear {{REQUESTER}},

We confirm receipt of your preservation order dated {{REQUEST_DATE}}{{REQUESTER_DOC_ID}}.

Please find our service of process information enclosed below:

Legal process should be addressed to "4chan Custodian of Records" and e-mailed to lawenforcement@4chan.org. We do not accept process via any other means at this time.

If your agency requires an address be listed on legal process, you may use:

4chan community support LLC
ATTN: Custodian of Records
2885 Sanford Ave Sw #34441
Grandville Mi 49418-1342

If this information is not already on file with your agency or preferred database, we request you update your records. All other addresses/phone numbers are invalid and may delay or result in no response.

Please note that 4chan retains few, if any, records about expired/pruned postings. Postings usually expire within hours to days at most, and we generally must receive a preservation order, emergency request, or other legal process within 12-24 hours of a posting being made in order to preserve or retrieve records prior to their expiration. Some exceptions exist however, including when a user has been blocked from posting, and/or when their posting(s) have been removed by a moderator.

Please let us know if you have any additional questions or require further assistance.

Regards,

4chan LEO Support

I think the VN discussion lends to the anime adaptation threads discussion and keeps them from getting boring, so if the threads are gonna be on the board anyway we might as well let the VN discussion too. Also another idea would be to send them to /vg/, but I think that getting some new users into /jp/ even though /jp/ will hate it might do it some good but this could only happen if the /jp/ janitors are willing to put up with fighting the board which I doubt any of you would. <br>Also I&#039;ve voiced my opinion before on the general threads, I think the idolm@s fans should be kicked off if it isn&#039;t anime related. I hate the key general as well, there is no reason for either thread in my opinion and all it does is add pointless shit being reported and more work for janitors/mods. The thing is even if we bring heavy moderation up against this they are just going to evade and continue to have the threads during times when there&#039;s no moderation so even though I hate them and many on the board hate them, unless these people decide that they are going to leave the board I don&#039;t see us getting rid of them anytime soon unless more people ;_;.<br>The VNs though, we could try to enforce more on. <br>But maybe the rule should be changed to tell them to take it to /vg/.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc2955"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa2955">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p2955" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim2955">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1374622709">07/23/13(Tue)19:38 <a href="#p2955" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('2955');" title="Reply to this post">2955</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi2955"><input type="checkbox" name="2955" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1374622709">07/23/13(Tue)19:38</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p2955" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('2955');" title="Reply to this post">2955</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m2955">Wouldn&#039;t surprise me if &quot;I want to fuck Yayoi&quot; has been said over a million times.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc2956"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa2956">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p2956" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim2956">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1374623424">07/23/13(Tue)19:50 <a href="#p2956" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('2956');" title="Reply to this post">2956</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi2956"><input type="checkbox" name="2956" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1374623424">07/23/13(Tue)19:50</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p2956" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('2956');" title="Reply to this post">2956</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m2956"><a href="#p2955" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;2955</a><br>Looking at the foolz archive and searching for the phrase &quot;I want to fuck Yayoi&quot; returns 55 pages of results.

Every board in 4chan has at least one purpose (not considering /s4s/ and others), and one topic that will ultimately fall there. But /jp/ has been created to hold a plethora of topics, that were proliferating all over /a/ in 2008, turning the board essentially into 2D/Random. What&#039;s currently happening there is that these same topics that were supposed to stay on /jp/, have again found a way to return to the board, through acceptance of users (that will naturally happen, since most /a/nons are not only interested in anime, but in otaku culture) and almost no action taken by the moderation. Regardless of the silly elitism and fear many /jp/ers hold towards /a/nons, we can&#039;t simply let the board live just because it will flood /a/ with touhou in case the board is deleted. We can&#039;t simply kill it&#039;s purpose of existence because some /a/nons want to talk about japanese culture topics with other /a/nons. This is what I&#039;m against. Essentially turning the board into a useless wasteland filled with Touhou and untranslated VNs discussion, with a few misc. topics.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3046"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3046">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3046" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3046">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1375719272">08/05/13(Mon)12:14 <a href="#p3046" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3046');" title="Reply to this post">3046</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3046"><input type="checkbox" name="3046" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1375719272">08/05/13(Mon)12:14</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3046" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3046');" title="Reply to this post">3046</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f3046"><div class="fileText" id="fT3046">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1375719272031.jpg" target="_blank">1344711981237.jpg</a> (35 KB, 175x232)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1375719272031.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1375719272031s.jpg" alt="35 KB" data-md5="0wRoh6FJDReZcNmg0RuNPA==" style="height: 125px; width: 94px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">35 KB JPG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3046">(cont.)<br><br>And here&#039;s the thing. Are we just going to allow VN threads that house no anime discussion, just because users accept it? Of course they will, they watch anime, after all. They are deeply tied into the core of otaku culture. It&#039;s just natural that they&#039;ll want to explore other parts of it, such as Visual Novels and Action Figures. But, is this right? Literally accepting the subject matters that were the reason for /jp/&#039;s existence because users said it&#039;s alright? In my opinion, no. Moot created /jp/ for Otaku Culture, and /a/ for Anime and Manga. Just like anime discussion is 99% of the times forbidden on /jp/ (usually accepting old anime threads, and even then, very rarely), even if many users watch anime and can discuss about it, we shouldn&#039;t allow VN threads to bloom and hold such solid fanbases and threads on /a/ just because it has an anime, that has/hasn&#039;t aired already/yet.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3047"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3047">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3047" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3047">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #FF0080'>Anonymous ## Manager</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1375730162">08/05/13(Mon)15:16 <a href="#p3047" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3047');" title="Reply to this post">3047</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3047"><input type="checkbox" name="3047" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #FF0080'>Anonymous ## Manager</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1375730162">08/05/13(Mon)15:16</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3047" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3047');" title="Reply to this post">3047</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3047">Here&#039;s my suggestion:<br><br>● Untranslated Japanese VN discussion goes on /jp/.<br>● Western VNs should be posted on /vg/.<br>● Translated Japanese VNs can go on either /jp/ or /vg/.<br>● Discussions of anime adaptations of VNs go on /a/.

There are many cases where a VN has an anime adaptation, and it&#039;s perfectly OK to discuss material from the VN in a thread discussing that anime adaptation. However, it is not OK to have a thread devoted to the VN just because there exists an anime adaptation. Threads need to be about the anime.<br><br>There are also Japanese games that are of interest to posters on /a/, for instance Kantai Collection/Kancolle. These games might use anime art styles, they might use anime tropes, and they might inspire tons of fan art, but they aren&#039;t anime/manga. With Kancolle, there are manga adaptations, and there is an upcoming series, so discussions pertaining to the anime &amp; manga are OK. Also, if a thread devoted to the anime or manga contains discussion about the games, that&#039;s OK so long as the thread is primarily about the series, and not merely being used as window dressing to discuss the game. Threads about Japanese language games like this should go on /jp/ or perhaps /vg/.<br><br>Another example of a game that some /a/ posters want to talk about is the idolm@ster series. Same thing applies. There are anime &amp; manga adaptations which can be discussed with no issues, and talking about the video game source material in those threads is absolutely fine. Having threads about the game series itself is not. Since there is a currently &#039;airing&#039; web animation series related to idolm@ster, this shouldn&#039;t be a huge issue, as they tend to stick to their generals.<br><br>There are lots of examples of things like this; tons of media and games use anime art styles, character archetypes, and typical anime tropes (touhou, mobages, browser games, ccgs, rpgs, etc). Tons of things started as a VN or a game and then were adapted to anime/manga. However, if threads aren&#039;t directly related to an anime series or a manga, then it shouldn&#039;t be on /a/.<br><br>This includes &quot;board culture&quot; threads. As an example: https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06813219/. &quot;You wake up and you&#039;re a girl now&quot; is a pretty common trope in anime, and there are plenty of people on /a/ who wish to be the little girl. Really though, that thread is not related to anime. You could replace the anime style fan art in the OP with a western style picture, and the rest of the thread wouldn&#039;t change. The thread isn&#039;t about anime or manga, it&#039;s just a topic which people who happen enjoy anime &amp; manga also find interesting (in this case, gender swapping).<br><br>Now the thread could have been something like &quot;Which manga series had the best portrayal of gender swapping?&quot; or &quot;Why is gender swapping a common theme in anime?&quot;. That would have linked the topic directly to discussions of anime &amp; manga, and would&#039;ve been perfectly fine. But without the thread being based directly in anime or manga, discussion is going to wander all over the place and almost certain to be completely off-topic for the board.<br><br>Obviously there are plenty of things that fall within this &quot;board culture&quot; domain, and deciding what stays and what goes is going to be a real minefield to navigate. Some of these threads can simply be directed to another board. For instance monster girl threads. <br><br>Lastly, there are a bunch of Japanese culture boards for a reason: to allow people to find what they&#039;re interested in more easily, and to allow enough room such that threads about niche topics don&#039;t plummet off a fast moving board without getting replies. Basically more boards = more room for slower, higher quality discussions. Cramming everything related to Japanese media on one board, like /a/ naturally tends to want, would mean an incredibly fast moving board where niche topics vanish (meaning only the most mainstream discussions survive). A fast moving board also means that in order to get replies you have to grab people&#039;s attention right away, and can&#039;t take the time necessary to type a thoughtful high-quality post. This leads to glib, lower quality comments, and the tendency to rely on obnoxious images to grab attention. Speed kills quality, and cramming tons of ancillary topics on /a/ speeds the board up. We need to get users to use the other Japanese media boards, especially /jp/, but also /c/ and /e/.<br><br>Things that should go on /jp/:<br>● Vocaloid threads.<br>● iDOLM@STER game discussion; discussion of airing or previous anime series is fine.<br>● Threads started about and/or primarily about VNs.<br>● Buyfag/Merchandise threads<br><br>Things that should go on /c/:<br>● Threads that are primarily image dumps focused on a particular character or series of the moe art style (which encompasses a lot of modern anime).<br>● Image dumps focusing on a particular moe theme, which include images from many different series &amp; characters.<br><br><br>Things that should go on /e/:<br>● Threads that are primarily image dumps focused on a particular character or series, with the focus being on &#039;lewd&#039; or sexy/suggestive poses.<br>● Image dumps focusing on a particular lewd theme, which include images from many different series &amp; characters. Meaning, threads talking about a particular body part, pose, that sort of thing. So for example: https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06814740/<br><br>For a complex policy change such as this one, completely silent moderation will be very, very confusing for users. To make these changes as painless as possible for everyone involved, we should try to do so using modposts and locks instead of bans and deletions. Explain the policy calmly and respectfully in a single post (do not reply to or respond to users complaining, or debate the policy, or belittle posters), then direct the users to the correct board, and finally lock the thread. It might be helpful to permasage the thread for a few minutes before modposting, such that the modpost doesn&#039;t bump the thread and cause the capcode to attract undue attention. The goal here is to communicate with people who were already following the thread, not to attract gawkers and complainers from /a/ in general who happen to see a modpost on the first page. So for janitors, try to bring problem threads to a mod&#039;s attention in cases where you think it might be worthwhile for them to post.<br><br>/a/ is not going to want to change; posters on /a/ do not necessarily see the big picture, and do not understand how a &quot;big tent&quot; board where tangentially related topics are kosher inevitably leads to problems. They do understand that the end result of a fast board is undesirable - they experience it every day, but they do not seem to grasp that directing different topics to different boards is meant to prevent any one board from getting too fast in the first place. They will resent us trying to move content they like somewhere else, but the end result will mean slower, higher quality discussion with well thought out posts, and more room for niche topics which would otherwise be drowned out by the flavor-of-the-week, and that will be better for the community overall.<br><br>What do you guys think?</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3743"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3743">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3743" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3743">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399469237">05/07/14(Wed)09:27:17 <a href="#p3743" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3743');" title="Reply to this post">3743</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3743"><input type="checkbox" name="3743" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399469237">05/07/14(Wed)09:27:17</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3743" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3743');" title="Reply to this post">3743</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3743"><a href="#p3742" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3742</a><br>Attempting to push image dump threads to /c/ won&#039;t be a painless process on either end, but if you&#039;re going to do it, /c/ welcomes image dumps for any (female) anime characters regardless of &quot;moe art style.&quot;</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3744"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3744">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3744" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3744">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399469499">05/07/14(Wed)09:31:39 <a href="#p3744" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3744');" title="Reply to this post">3744</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3744"><input type="checkbox" name="3744" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399469499">05/07/14(Wed)09:31:39</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3744" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3744');" title="Reply to this post">3744</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3744"><a href="#p3742" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3742</a><br>You know, with the popularity of generals ever increasing on all boards, the mainstream threads do in fact become generals/fast moving threads and discussion seems to go no where. <br>With that being said, I feel like the whole website has adopted a &quot;home&quot; board and will not like the transition of moving, because they have established that they can get into discussions in these generals/fast moving threads without having to venture to another board for that topic. <br>I don&#039;t think that for a second this will be easy, but I am for this decision with not only /a/, but the all boards.

Once a new season gets underway, post activity rises and there&#039;s a lot more on-topic threads focused on seasonal shows and the discussion of their weekly content therein. The quality and nature of that discussion tends to vary greatly depending on the quality of the season, but it generally dominates the 1st page. After a season ends, and for about 1-2 months in that transition period where new shows haven&#039;t aired yet or picked up enough steam to really get going, /a/ essentially runs out of things to talk about. No weekly show to discuss -or at least nothing worth talking about- which leaves posters to perpetually revive a thread from some show that has already finished until they can exhaust very possible option for discussion and imagedumps (the infamous madoka general), or go back to talking about kancolle, buyfagging or whatever other &#039;otaku&#039; hobby that&#039;s used to fill the void until there&#039;s more anime content to discuss.<br><br>This unsteady nature to the production of discussion-worthy content on /a/ is part of what has made it a home to all these things that ought to belong in /jp/, but also reflects necessity. /a/ tends to conduct itself as a board on the topic of the japanese animation industry as a whole, and not just &#039;anime&#039; because the industry is a constant, and the interrelationships of production and association allow for constant topics for discussion even when there&#039;s a lack of new anime content. This is why a lot of things like im@s, vocaloid and sales recieve so much attention. Since these things remain pretty much constant outside of the anime production cycle, the threads will perpetuate themselves with imagedumps in order to maintain a presence during an active season, when interest is low, so that they can become an active home for posters again when a season is over. <br><br>Your direction is solid, but be weary of the above in any radical policy shift.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3746"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3746">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3746" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3746">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399472741">05/07/14(Wed)10:25:41 <a href="#p3746" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3746');" title="Reply to this post">3746</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3746"><input type="checkbox" name="3746" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399472741">05/07/14(Wed)10:25:41</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3746" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3746');" title="Reply to this post">3746</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3746"><a href="#p3742" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3742</a><br>I agree on Vocaloid threads and VNs, provided they are not actually related to an anime in any way, but IM@S and Buyfag is going to be a tough sell. Buyfag threads have been around /a/ for a long time, and they&#039;re fully aware buyfag threads exist on other boards (and they are aware of /toy/ and so on) and deliberately choose not to go to those places, to discuss anime/manga only related merch. I don&#039;t see it as a huge issue, personally, though I do understand the desire to clean up the board these two groups comprise of people who post many other things on /a/, and it could cause real problems. (IM@S has an anime, this will cause complaining)<br><br>As for the image dumps which are strictly image dumps, yeah, they _should_ go to /c/. I&#039;m not sure what difference it will make (e.g. &quot;Kirino thread&quot; versus &quot;Oreimo thread&quot;) in the long run, or if it&#039;s worth making people irrationally angry, but that&#039;s not really my call. That said, /c/ is pretty useless right now to most /a/ users. Maybe they&#039;d use /c/ more, or maybe they&#039;d just evade rules and make more general threads, in which case I&#039;m not sure what the purpose would be. Plenty of /a/ users think of /a/ as their stronghold against shitty posting, and since it&#039;s more active than /c/ (by far)... It&#039;s an incentive problem.<br><br>/a/ clearly has more users and more entertaining discussion (this is their perception, anyway)<br>/c/ is clearly for image dumping, but very little discussion goes on there outside of translation threads or information sharing, there&#039;s no general /a/-like banter whatsoever.<br><br>So given those two choices, I think users will simply choose /a/ and find some way around this rule.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3747"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3747">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3747" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3747">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399473330">05/07/14(Wed)10:35:30 <a href="#p3747" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3747');" title="Reply to this post">3747</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3747"><input type="checkbox" name="3747" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399473330">05/07/14(Wed)10:35:30</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3747" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3747');" title="Reply to this post">3747</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3747"><a href="#p3742" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3742</a><br><a href="#p3746" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3746</a><br>as for /e/, I really don&#039;t see /a/ users heading over there to talk about specific body parts.

At this current point we are at a half rebellion from the board I&#039;d say. <br>The recent activity hasn&#039;t been such to rub the board the wrong way but any one thing could lead to a situation similar to /sp/ and /tv/. A lot of the things that the other boards suffer for /a/ doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s just sort of accepted by everyone as being a part of the everyday discussion. I can understand thinking that something may be wrong with a lot of these threads when facing complaints from the community, there has been a lot of discussion within the team recently about a lot of the subjects I&#039;m sure you&#039;re reciveing complaints about.<br>A lot of the threads that are being talked about know they are borderline, many of the loli threads are there now because action was taken previosuly on the &quot;harmless&quot; ones. <br>Going after the Zeveda image had a big impact in my opinion on the users opinion of the style of moderation being brought by the none /a/ mods (no offense intended) so the best way is to reach a comprimise on all issue together before going to the users and just telling them things.<br>Many of the things who /a/ would call normalfags might be complaining about like loli thread are because they don&#039;t have the concept that yea there might be some legit sickos amongest the dregs of society that many of us detach the 2D world from the real world.

I feel that /a/&#039;s quality as a board is generally dictated by the amount of content being discussed. When /a/ runs out of things to talk about, they resort to shitposting to fill the void, but the more stuff there is to talk about (and the more diverse) the better things are. Posters will not relocate just because we disallow a topic. Yes, im@s fans may go to /jp/ to post about im@sk, but they&#039;ll still spend their time browsing and posting on /a, only now without being able to post about im@s on /a/, they&#039;ll find something else to post about, to fill the void. When you create a content, void, /a/ almost always fills it with shitposting, because they can&#039;t generate content to fill the content void themselves, and have to wait for japan to produce something. Content voids occur naturally just from season to season, and /a/ fills them with tangentially related stuff like im@s and vocaloid, because they want to maintain that quality of discourse, even when there&#039;s no anime worth talking about. If we create a content void by forbidding or relocating these things, the pool of valid content will decline sharply, but the userbase will not, and this void will encourage endemic shitposting and become an obstacle to anime discussion. <br><br>I think our focus should be not so much on strictly defining what qualifies as /a/ material and not /a/ material, but rather on what material constitutes a thread that is up to the posting standards of /a/. The approach that was taken to Naruto threads should serve as a good example; With threads restricted to the weekly release, it ensures the threads are always on-topic and content-focused while maintaining minimal board presence.<br><br>I feel like that approach should be taken towards the problem threads outlined. Particularly Monster Girl threads, im@s, vocaloid and etc.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3756"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3756">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3756" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3756">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399495815">05/07/14(Wed)16:50:15 <a href="#p3756" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3756');" title="Reply to this post">3756</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3756"><input type="checkbox" name="3756" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399495815">05/07/14(Wed)16:50:15</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3756" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3756');" title="Reply to this post">3756</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3756"><a href="#p3748" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3748</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;If /c/ welcomed discussion of moe anime &amp; characters, would that help matters?</span><br>No, nobody wants to go to a different board to talk about the majority of anime. <br>This will just create a really, really hostile posting environment on /a/ that we don&#039;t want. <br>I think like one of the janitors said it&#039;s about incentive rather than the content of the thread, /a/ regards itself as the best place on the internet to discuss anime even if the quality is sub par at points and even some of the sub par stuff is entertaining. <br>If the idea here is to get threads moved the best one that would get rid of the biggest problem ones (in my opinion idolm@s, some of the yuri and yaoi related content,key general, sad panda, homo general, maybe some of the random style breeding material threads many of these gray area threads) is to create an anime/random board. <br>But, I am of the opinion that maybe /jp/ should stay if they are still on the chopping block over it, I have no stake in /jp/, but it would seem that /a/&#039;s problems seem to stem a little from picking up /jp/ content.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3757"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3757">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3757" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3757">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399496226">05/07/14(Wed)16:57:06 <a href="#p3757" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3757');" title="Reply to this post">3757</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3757"><input type="checkbox" name="3757" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399496226">05/07/14(Wed)16:57:06</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3757" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3757');" title="Reply to this post">3757</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3757"><a href="#p3755" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3755</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;I think our focus should be not so much on strictly defining what qualifies as /a/ material and not /a/ material, but rather on what material constitutes a thread that is up to the posting standards of /a/.

From the experience I have, in /a/, /jp/ and /vg/ threads, the three of them hold very distinct userbases. This may seem like a lax approach towards the issue, but essentially a thick barrier against translated titles has been created in /jp/. This leads to most users feeling reluctant when posting on the VN General, and the fact that it IS a general makes things worse, because they become scared of posting simple VN threads on the board. You see, this is the only board they can actually just go and post about a title they have just played, whereas /vg/ they would be forced to post on the general, and /a/ they would get their thread most likely deleted. Due to these circumstances regarding the sheer elitism from one board and a limited environment in the other, I take a stance towards occasionally letting them be on /a/. HOWEVER, I am explicitly against Muv Luv, Umineko, Majikoi, and other VN threads that would be essentially be considered recurring generals, with Fate/Stay Night being an exception due to frequent anime and manga adaptations. Yes, I realize I am taking an inverted stance towards the policy I first presented, but this is due to the experience I&#039;ve acquired by frequenting the VN threads on /jp/ and /vg/. <br><br>Regarding Kancolle, I see no reason to let them alive as the general format currently being followed. Any kind of discussion regarding the manga, the Light Novels, and the doujinshi about Kancolle can be done in /jp/, and even /a/ to an extent, as long as the thread explicitly shows a desire to discuss the manga, the anime or the Light Novel. The way it currently is, it&#039;s just a little excuse to talk about the game itself.

Since we&#039;re cracking down on generals, we might as well take down the Monster Girl threads, as you&#039;ve mentioned, so justice is fair with everyone. The main problem I see on /a/ nowadays is this tendency to slowly create generals for more popular themes. They mostly could be redirected to other boards, but I propose the following: let&#039;s give a certain freedom for /a/ to talk about topics such as action figures, Visual Novels, and lewd anime art, but OCCASIONALLY. If we ever notice generals are being formed, we take &#039;em down as soon as possible. What do I wish to accomplish by taking this stance? You see, /a/ will be extremely bothered by this sudden change of policy, and they will create a huge amount of backlash, so in an effort to reduce such an unnecessary war between moderation and the userbase, we propose a deal: as long as no generals are formed and threads aren&#039;t constantly made about topics with indirect connections to anime and manga, we let them be.

The faster a board is, the lower the quality of posting. People post on 4chan in order to get replies, and on a fast board you need to post fast to get anyone to respond to you. That means the level of discourse drops precipitously as people try to post faster &amp; faster. <br><br>The more topics that get crammed onto a board, the faster it gets. And &quot;occasionally&quot; allowing some /jp/ content on /a/ is opening the door to all /jp/ content being allowed on /a/, as &quot;occasionally&quot; is subjective and entirely up to the discretion of the mod or janitor looking at it. Once the precedent is set, then because of the &quot;/jp/ is a sewer&quot; notion, all of /jp/&#039;s posters and content will just migrate to /a/, like is already well underway. People post pure VN threads that get hundreds of replies on /a/, whereas on /jp/ there are only a handful of truly active threads.<br><br>Let&#039;s take things to an extreme. If for instance, we were to make /a/ NWS and nuke all the other Japanese media boards what would that look like? Everyone would be able to post whatever Japanese media they liked without having to worry about being off-topic. But would you be able to have a quality discussion about a non-mainstream or less popular series, or would such a thread plummet off the board with no replies? How many porn threads do you think there would be? How many generals would arise? The natural tendency of posters is to want that board, but if they ever were to actually *get* that board, they&#039;d hate it because it would be little more than Japan flavored /b/.<br><br>Everyone, including staff, needs to get past the notion that /jp/ is somehow inherently bad and that board culture is some insurmountable barrier. If posters on /a/ have to discuss VNs on /jp/, they will bring their attitude and culture with them. Changing an &#039;a&#039; to a &#039;jp&#039; in the address bar doesn&#039;t turn them into different people. But I agree that redirecting users needs to be done in a non-confrontational and respectful manner, lest users think they are being insulted or punished somehow. Hence why I think the best way of redirecting people to the correct board is something like this:<br><br><span class="quote">&gt;Such and such topic should be discussed on such and such board, except when directly relating this topic to an anime or manga series. Please remake this thread there.</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;Thank you.</span><br><br>Immediately followed by a lock. Ideally one would permasage the thread before modposting, to prevent it from being bumped and drawing in outside posters who happen to see a mod posting.<br><br><a href="#p3762" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3762</a><br>Words like &quot;certain freedom&quot; and &quot;occasionally&quot; imply subjectivity. Everyone on the team is going to be drawing the line in a different place, and in the interest of keeping the peace and giving users a relaxed environment, we will inevitably allow more and more tertiary discussion, and just end up allowing even more /jp/, /c/ and /e/ material on /a/ than we do right now.<br><br>My goal here isn&#039;t to attack /a/&#039;s userbase or needlessly cause strife with /a/&#039;s posters. My goal here is to preserve /a/&#039;s level of discourse, which has deteriorated significantly in the past year or so. /a/ now generates more reports than /v/ and /vg/ combined. While the majority of those reports are spurious and merely get cleared, there&#039;s still quite a lot of the low quality shitposting that /a/ derides other boards for. Everyone clamouring into /a/ because &quot;all their friends are here&quot; or &quot;/jp/ is a shithole&quot; just means that /a/ gets faster and faster, and shitposting becomes more common as the board transitions from discussion forum to chatroom-with-images. Nobody should see other boards as prisons where they are exiled. They should just open each board&#039;s catalog in a different tab (like every single browser today can do), and take advantage of the extra room for interesting and higher quality discussions that result from having multiple boards.<br><br>Maybe a software solution is the best way to go. We might never be able to get past the preconceptions that users have about other boards (which to my mind are completely ridiculous). If we had some way of allowing users to build their own boards out of topics that they liked, and labelled new threads using drop-downs or tags for different topics, then we might be able to dispense with the notion of fixed boards entirely. That&#039;s likely a pipe dream though, given 4chan&#039;s limited resources.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3767"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3767">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3767" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3767">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #FF0080'>Anonymous ## Manager</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399523399">05/08/14(Thu)00:29:59 <a href="#p3767" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3767');" title="Reply to this post">3767</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3767"><input type="checkbox" name="3767" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #FF0080'>Anonymous ## Manager</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399523399">05/08/14(Thu)00:29:59</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3767" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3767');" title="Reply to this post">3767</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3767">Also, here are some examples of threads that have been redirected, just so you can get an idea of the sort of stuff I&#039;m trying to target.<br><br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06820973/#106846611<br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06848929/#106877410<br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06838891/#106879466<br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06856489/#106881966<br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06890448/#106892927<br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06888657/#106893157<br><br>Also this is relevant:<br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06890448/#106892927_2<br>https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/1<wbr>06890448/#106892927_4<br>While users might not agree with or like change, they do seem to understand why.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3769"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3769">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3769" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3769">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399524928">05/08/14(Thu)00:55:28 <a href="#p3769" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3769');" title="Reply to this post">3769</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3769"><input type="checkbox" name="3769" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399524928">05/08/14(Thu)00:55:28</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3769" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3769');" title="Reply to this post">3769</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3769"><a href="#p3753" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3753</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;Suggest that threads dedicated to character worship rather than discussion outside of waifu threads belong on /c/.</span><br>I completely agree with this.

Because of the way it determines board relevance (medium, as opposed to content), it gives the appearance of severely restricting the ways in which people can begin a conversation about the franchise, and thus the only way for a poster to work around this is to make/find a general thread and then post about the aspect of the franchise they&#039;re interested in there. And god forbid we get two parallel general threads going - that would definitely be unnecessarily confusing for users.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3789"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3789">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3789" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3789">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399574166">05/08/14(Thu)14:36:06 <a href="#p3789" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3789');" title="Reply to this post">3789</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3789"><input type="checkbox" name="3789" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399574166">05/08/14(Thu)14:36:06</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3789" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3789');" title="Reply to this post">3789</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3789"><a href="#p3785" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3785</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;Users who feel that they are being treated unfairly are definitely going to become a problem when moderation activity increases</span><br>And as they are forcibly migrated to /c/ and /e/ I expect the quality of their threads there will be pretty awful to begin with, and I don&#039;t want to see those threads become anti-moderation plotting headquarters. The first thing the /a/ Ryuko posters did after merging with the /c/ threads (which until that point were 99% fanart and largely textless) was complain and discuss if and how they could get their threads back on /a/. And just today, somebody made this post: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/c/2221262</span><br><br>So months later, they still want to go back to /a/. Any threads that migrate from /a/ will have to make some sacrifices - like the Ryuko threads putting their writing in pastebins instead of the threads, and leaving their exhentai links behind.

They stay separated, contained to their home threads where they don&#039;t have to concenr themselves with the overall quality of the board and become uninvolved with /a/ as a whole.

We need to be able to give people a heads up that their threads will be shitted in, but that we will be policing them until things die down.

And I see these threads. And then I say to myself: are you serious? Is this really anime or manga? Why is this allowed? Do these threads not get reported? So I throw up my hands, turn 360 degrees, and walk away. I&#039;m not going to root through all this garbage to find a thread about Generic School Show #87, episode 35. What do I know about /a/?

With regards to WIXOSS, it is perfectly acceptable on /tg/ because it is a card game. I have already started and will continue to delete meta discussion about whether or not this is /a/ or /jp/ related, because that meta discussion is not a traditional game or even a game at all! It&#039;s complete bullshit, and if you want to talk about complete bullshit you can go to the /b/ullshit board. If the users would like to sneak in discussion about the show or whatever, that&#039;s fine too, but it should pertain about how the show is relevant to the card game. Things like the setting or how to expand it, or how the characters act are all moderately OK as long as it doesn&#039;t go out of hand.<br><br>I also don&#039;t see a reason to remove all WIXOSS-the-anime discussion from /a/. I can&#039;t speak about /jp/, but to my inexperienced eye, it seems that WIXOSS might qualify as a &quot;niche Japanese interest&quot; as per the /jp/ rules. I can&#039;t make that call, though. Same goes for YuGiOh. It&#039;s not a popular topic, but it is always welcome on /tg/. Heck, it would probably be OK to talk about the show here too, because it&#039;s so closely tied to the game and might be a neato setting. That doesn&#039;t mean you cannot talk about it on /a/. As a 4chan janitor who does it for free, I have always felt it to be my responsibility to get rid of bullshit meta discussion from threads that are acceptable for the board. Yes, even in threads I don&#039;t personally like, or threads where a lot of users complain! If people are talking about something on-topic, and a lot of users are preventing that discussion from taking place, it is my responsibility to get rid of the users preventing the discussion. <br><br>cont.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3806"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3806">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3806" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3806">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399661790">05/09/14(Fri)14:56:30 <a href="#p3806" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3806');" title="Reply to this post">3806</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3806"><input type="checkbox" name="3806" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399661790">05/09/14(Fri)14:56:30</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3806" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3806');" title="Reply to this post">3806</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f3806"><div class="fileText" id="fT3806">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1399661790203.jpg" target="_blank">Sumomo.(Chobits).full.33067.jpg</a> (417 KB, 1192x894)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1399661790203.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1399661790203s.jpg" alt="417 KB" data-md5="Ai5SjAWnhuWE2yEENQYpiA==" style="height: 93px; width: 125px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">417 KB JPG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3806"><a href="#p3805" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3805</a><br>Caving in to the demands of complainers to get rid of a thread about something they don&#039;t like (but is otherwise acceptable) is terrible precedent.

Whether it&#039;s decided we ban /jp/, /tg/, /c/ and /e/ threads or not, there&#039;s a lot of janitor preference dictating janitor action, rather than just adhering to a set of rules. I&#039;m not sure if this is fine and something I just have to get used to, maybe everyone is used to just going with their gut but there is going to be edge cases and in those cases I feel it&#039;d be better if we left the topic alone rather than leave it up to janitor preference. I&#039;ll elaborate if anyone asks, but I feel that&#039;s one main thing stopping the report queue on /a/ from being a little cleaner.<br><br>So whether the changes go through or not, some sort of stricter (not necessarily meaning more deletions or bans, could in fact mean less depending on the route we take, just stricter meaning more concise) guidelines would be nice. If somebody tells me I should just know a shitpost when I see it I can try my best, but either mistakes will be made or inaction will be the result (some higher up determines something a shitpost and I won&#039;t remove it, or I remove something and a higher up determines it wasn&#039;t a shitpost, both seem like negative results to me). Would also be nice to say &quot;If something doesn&#039;t fit within these guidelines, it&#039;s okay to clear&quot;, meaning a majority of posts which don&#039;t fall under those guidelines can be cleared without worry.<br><br>Also not sure if this is relevant to the current subject of debate, but I figured I&#039;d throw it out there.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3811"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3811">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3811" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3811">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1399664641">05/09/14(Fri)15:44:01 <a href="#p3811" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3811');" title="Reply to this post">3811</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3811"><input type="checkbox" name="3811" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1399664641">05/09/14(Fri)15:44:01</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3811" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3811');" title="Reply to this post">3811</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3811"><a href="#p3804" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3804</a><br><a href="#p3807" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;3807</a><br>It is also how /a/ drives away outsiders and those who don&#039;t want to lurk.

Reposting here for anybody else interested:<br><br>The other mods/janitors and I who commonly frequent /a/ wished to make a suggestion that we think may improve the browsing experience for anime/manga watchers on 4chan. I understand you’re a busy man, so I’ll try to be brief.<br> <br>Current Issues with /a/<br>-increased post-timer making it more difficult for people to quickly post manga chapters and attract interest<br>-Exponential increase of userbase without the benefit of numerous board splits like /v/ has experienced with /vp/, /vg/, and /vr/<br>-Clutter from outright, tangentially, or vaguely off-topic threads<br> <br>Possible Solution<br>The first issue in the above-section can be easily solved by reducing the post-timer down to 35 or 45 seconds. For the other issues, we suggest two possible options.<br> <br>Option 1) Reallocation of tangentially /a/-related topics not to new boards, but already-existing boards (/c/ and /e/) with some slight modifications to their board rules. Instead of radically changing these boards, we propose that these rarely-used boards be modified from an image dumping-focused board to one that can be home to active discussion as well.<br> <br>Rationale for altering /c/ and /e/:<br>We believe /c/ and /e/ are outdated concepts of a time when the online anime community was smaller and it was difficult to find fanart of a specific topic or character. With the proliferation of sites like danbooru, gelbooru, or exhentai, finding anime fanart has never been easier. Thus, instead of axing these two small boards, we suggest it also house general discussions of waifus. Waifu discussion will still be accepted in /a/, as long as they happen inside a thread discussing a specific show (ex. people talking about female character X in a thread about show Z).<br>What this move is intended for, is to relocate only tangentially on-topic threads from /a/ such as:<br>-What attracted you to your waifu?<br>-What’ll you do with your waifu for Valentine’s?<br>-Who homu here? (example of a “character worship” thread mainly full of image-dumping and how cute/sexy a certain character is)<br> <br>Keep in mind this is distinct from threads such as “Was the action of character X in show Y right or wrong?” or “Why did character Z act like such a bitch throughout the show?” which is still /a/-material.<br> <br>Also, this board can naturally accommodate threads discussing a specific character type. Examples of such threads are:<br>-Who is the best milf in anime?<br>-Why are anime lolis so huggable?<br>-Tsundere is the worst anime character archetype!<br> <br>The dividing line between what’s /c/-content and /e/-content will be the same as now.

It&#039;s a misconception that discussion isn&#039;t allowed on /c/ -- discussion of characters is fairly common and coexists well with the pure image dumping, so long as people wanting to discuss their waifus also post relevant images. And honestly, I think it would be a mistake to make a deliberate allowance for image-less waifu discussion. Solitary anime characters really just don&#039;t deserve entire threads on an IMAGEboard dedicated solely to text-only rehashes on the subject of &quot;why is she so perfect?&quot; Character threads that have already been &quot;moved&quot; from /a/ to /c/ (or more accurately, merged with the /c/ threads that already existed), like Ryuko threads, have adapted fine as is.<br><br>Personally, I don&#039;t think character threads are nearly as much of a problem as /a/&#039;s plague of off-topic ecchi threads. &quot;What&#039;s the best anime related fetish?&quot; &quot;Imoutous are for _______&quot; &quot;So why do we hate MILFs?&quot; &quot;Would you lick her armpits?&quot; and others are all repeat hits on /a/ that drop below any reasonable threshold of anime-relatedness and become contests to see who can post the most risque Gelbooru and Exhentai images without getting banned. These threads clearly belong on /e/ -- again, without any modification to /e/&#039;s current rules -- and I think /e/ would be happy to have the content.<br><br>So, in short, /c/ and /e/ don&#039;t need changes if you would like to start moving threads to them. On the subject of SFW character threads, I think they should move to /c/ as long as they are held to a reasonable standard of quality image contribution (and lack of &quot;I just want to fuck her so bad!!!&quot;). I don&#039;t think /c/&#039;s rules need to change just so /a/&#039;s wordier character worship threads can move there without having to make a small adaptation -- particularly because /c/ already accepts discussion.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc4119"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa4119">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p4119" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim4119">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1407653245">08/10/14(Sun)02:47:25 <a href="#p4119" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('4119');" title="Reply to this post">4119</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi4119"><input type="checkbox" name="4119" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1407653245">08/10/14(Sun)02:47:25</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p4119" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('4119');" title="Reply to this post">4119</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f4119"><div class="fileText" id="fT4119">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1407653245524.jpg" target="_blank">goodjob.jpg</a> (35 KB, 500x281)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1407653245524.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1407653245524s.jpg" alt="35 KB" data-md5="NnlZVJEvNguvew4gBnistw==" style="height: 70px; width: 125px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">35 KB JPG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m4119"><a href="#p4114" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;4114</a><br>Just wanted to say that I agree with every point in this post.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc4120"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa4120">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p4120" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim4120">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1407659630">08/10/14(Sun)04:33:50 <a href="#p4120" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('4120');" title="Reply to this post">4120</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi4120"><input type="checkbox" name="4120" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1407659630">08/10/14(Sun)04:33:50</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p4120" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('4120');" title="Reply to this post">4120</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m4120"><a href="#p4114" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;4114</a><br>The problem is really the one little part at the bottom of /c/&#039;s sticky and it&#039;s really about covering all bases. <br>The one thing you don&#039;t want to do is give people an argument as to why they can&#039;t move, the thing with /a/ is people don&#039;t want to go to other boards and we&#039;re trying to get them to. <br>Even still, a radical change to /c/ would be to figure out how to get more than just this content onto the board, this would be sending like a third of the threads on /a/ onto /c/.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc4158"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa4158">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p4158" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim4158">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1409162115">08/27/14(Wed)13:55:15 <a href="#p4158" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('4158');" title="Reply to this post">4158</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi4158"><input type="checkbox" name="4158" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1409162115">08/27/14(Wed)13:55:15</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p4158" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('4158');" title="Reply to this post">4158</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m4158"><a href="#p4114" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;4114</a><br>The intention isn&#039;t to change /c/ or /e/, just a simple rewording of the board rules, or perhaps just the sticky to show these posters that they are welcome to post and aren&#039;t being punted off /a/ as a punishment.

We don&#039;t want to prevent people from posting any of the things they already have been posting, but if /a/ is going to remain a board specifically about anime and manga, and not simply become an altar of character worship, then we&#039;re going to have to shuffle some topics around.

Sometimes, it isn&#039;t too bad and there are just a few and they tend to be alright, but other times you can find 6, 7 threads which are usually just opposites of eachother. For example, one night I saw an ITT: Worst girl, best girl, post examples of good X, post examples of bad X, and is it really worth having nearly a pages worth of these types of threads? Aside from the monthly shitposting show, which this month seems to be Umaru, /a/ can be filled with a few pages worth of really low quality discussion.<br><br>On top of that, I&#039;ve also seen a lot of &quot;Picked up X, what am I in for?&quot; type of threads.

Sometimes they&#039;ll turn into decent discussions about the show in question, other times just shitposting, sometimes just stealth recommendations. <br><br>Lastly, with YrYr generals, I know they&#039;re making a stink of it, but what is the plan here, just wait it out basically? They&#039;ve long since outgrown having any real content in them besides blogging and imagedumps, but they bring up a good point about how the &#039;no generals&#039; thing is kind of unequally enforced. Madoka threads are quite similar, except they have an even worse case of off-topic blogging, tripfagging, and if it&#039;s that time of day, anti-crack bullshit.

I&#039;ve seen a lot of them with older shows and while the threads are rocky, I think it&#039;s nice to have a new thread that isn&#039;t the 5th iteration of the current big airing show, but mostly I was concerned with people using them for dubious means I.E &quot;Picked up SAO. What am I in for?&quot; and so on.

I don&#039;t know about you guys, but personally I think there&#039;s no real clear cut reason to remove said threads outright. I do get exasperated seeing nearly 10 of those threads up at once which are usually just mirror versions of eachother, but regardless I&#039;ve adopted a &#039;wait and see&#039; approach to them because after around 20 - 30 posts it&#039;s apparent what the OP intended and if the thread is just a true shitstorm or just a regular thread using typical 4chan rhetoric to start a discussion (ITT threads are very common obviously, and people DO use it to start threads with 100% intentions for good discussion)<br><br>With the Yuru issue, I&#039;ve browsed YrYr threads since they aired; so I&#039;m fairly familiar with them. Around the time the &#039;announcement&#039; was going to drop (hoping for S3, we got the OVA, but S3 came eventually) a large amount of users there were actually of the opinion the threads had devolved into Madoka-style blogging, mostly about their characters, occassional arguments about males in the show and whatever. I assumed a fair amount of these users eventually got frustrated and left. <br><br>So I&#039;m also in agreement that is going to be a good time to get all the completely off-topic blogging and I&#039;m assuming most regulars will be happy with that decision.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5021"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5021">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5021" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5021">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1447520776">11/14/15(Sat)12:06:16 <a href="#p5021" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5021');" title="Reply to this post">5021</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5021"><input type="checkbox" name="5021" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1447520776">11/14/15(Sat)12:06:16</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5021" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5021');" title="Reply to this post">5021</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5021">I just wanted to clarify our policy on something and maybe get a discussion going.<br>I had been told in the past that a few particular ongoing manga series (the big 3, snk, etc.) were to be contained to days in and around their new chapter release.

For another, LNs especially are a major source of adapted content for anime, and even manga. 11 of the 40 television shows airing this season alone are light novel adaptations and the trends and popular works of that industry are very relevant to anime as it has so much influence on what shows get made and what fads emerge.<br><br>I guess I&#039;m really just musing here, but my concern is more or less how productive this hair-splitting really is and if it could at least be better communicated to the users. I would definitely not advocate any sort of light novel general, but occasional threads discussing popular trends or awards seem at least somewhat relevant to the topic of the board, especially when the LNs in question tend to either already have an adaptation, or will likely be getting one sometime in the near future.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5032"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5032">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5032" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5032">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1448042393">11/20/15(Fri)12:59:53 <a href="#p5032" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5032');" title="Reply to this post">5032</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5032"><input type="checkbox" name="5032" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1448042393">11/20/15(Fri)12:59:53</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5032" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5032');" title="Reply to this post">5032</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5032"><a href="#p5031" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5031</a><br>I&#039;m not sure what hairs you think are being split here.

The special /jp/ rule practically enforces that only monstrously obscure LNs go to /jp/, which is basically carving off 1% of LN discussion from the other 99% and leaving it to die in a board that does not care about it.<br><br>Almost every LN anybody knows about gets an adaptation of some kind, often anime but also manga. Take a look at the top LN characters ranking - every single character in the top ten ranking for both genders has shown up in an animated adaptation with the single exception of Othinus from the Index novels. So the discussion of these anime characters (who are also light novel characters, but who most people on 4chan know from the anime) and all the associate requisite X-a-shit posting... belongs in /jp/? Users aren&#039;t going to figure that out and I don&#039;t blame them.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5156"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5156">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5156" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5156">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1452708626">01/13/16(Wed)13:10:26 <a href="#p5156" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5156');" title="Reply to this post">5156</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5156"><input type="checkbox" name="5156" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1452708626">01/13/16(Wed)13:10:26</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5156" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5156');" title="Reply to this post">5156</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5156">What&#039;s the policy on anime/manga-inspired Korean and Chinese animations and comics?

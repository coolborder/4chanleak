kicking the can on some key issues on /a/ for too long and the time is ripe to coordinate actions together to improve the quality of /a/.<br><br>I&#039;ve spoken to various mods and janitors and we&#039;ve hammered out &quot;official guidelines&quot; to address these issues. Here is what would be posted under mod capcode to various threads that require it:<br><br>&quot;Dear xx fans,<br>In an effort to improve the quality of posts on /a/, it&#039;s come to our attention that issues in xx threads should be addressed. To that end, here are a few suggestions:<br><br>1. Please focus on producing original discussion, questions, or content when creating or contributing to a thread; avoid template formats and “X Thread”-type posts. OPs should be insightful and specific, not general.<br>2. Please avoid reposting content from previous threads. This includes: resource pastebins, copypasta, forcing memes, image dumping, “xth for y”, “reminder x” and anything that fails to abide by #1.<br>3. Feel free to talk about similar content in separate threads.<br>4. Allow a thread to expire naturally.<br>5. Please avoid recurring thread topics that are not accompanied by content to discuss<br>6. Continue to abide by the global and /a/-specific rules outlined here: 4chan.org/rules<br><br>These suggestions are applicable to other threads on /a/.<br>If we keep to these guidelines, we can all enjoy /a/ together. Please report any rule breaking content too. Thanks again!&quot;<br><br>Please note: janitors shouldn&#039;t ban request generals unless they are persistently dodging efforts to remove them.<br><br>Also: lets open up the floor to discussion on what to do about:<br>1. DJT<br>2. moving potential /c/, /e/, /trash/ etc content<br>3. buyfag/drawfag threads<br><br>Thanks guys, im counting on your help!</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5738"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5738">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5738" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5738">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1479962719">11/23/16(Wed)23:45:19 <a href="#p5738" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5738');" title="Reply to this post">5738</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5738"><input type="checkbox" name="5738" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1479962719">11/23/16(Wed)23:45:19</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5738" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5738');" title="Reply to this post">5738</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f5738"><div class="fileText" id="fT5738">File: <a title="[HorribleSubs] Time Bokan 24 - 07 [720p].mkv_snapshot_00.20_[2016.11.24_04.44.52].jpg" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1479962719305.jpg" target="_blank">[HorribleSubs] Time Bokan(...).jpg</a> (90 KB, 1280x720)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1479962719305.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1479962719305s.jpg" alt="90 KB" data-md5="ZEu3HCvtijU1McdHNe/U9A==" style="height: 70px; width: 125px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">90 KB JPG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5738"><a href="#p5736" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5736</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;1.

Almost every image is an SFW image, with images of mostly clothed girls with nothing suggestive about them. It&#039;s true that a big part of /e/ is clothed girls that might otherwise be SFW but there are no whole threads full of just completely that. There is always NSFW mixed in. These threads would be much better suited for /c/.<br><br>There&#039;s also the fact that one of those threads has an OP of a pregnant girl. Any pictures featuring pregnancy have always been considered /d/. Am I supposed to just make an exception because it was moved from /a/? This leads me to my broader point:<br><br>The threads I&#039;ve seen moved from /a/ to /e/ largely ignore the rules and standards of /e/. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a case of mods not understanding what /e/ is supposed to be or what. A little while ago a thread from /a/ got moved that was full of giantess girls including one that was futanari. Obviously this belongs on /d/ and not /e/. Yet it was moved there. Why?<br><br><br>When I spoke to Rapeape a while ago about this, I voiced my concern about threads being moved that have posts that might be ok in /a/ but are not ok in /e/. As far as I can remember, he assured me that the threads will be checked before they&#039;re moved. This is obviously not happening. My main concern was that if I happen to come upon a thread and I could not tell if it was moved from /a/, that I would BR a post that broke the rules in /e/, so a poster would get banned for something they wouldn&#039;t have if the thread wasn&#039;t moved. They would get banned for something that wasn&#039;t even their fault.<br><br>(1/?)</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5740"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5740">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5740" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5740">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1479965952">11/24/16(Thu)00:39:12 <a href="#p5740" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5740');" title="Reply to this post">5740</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5740"><input type="checkbox" name="5740" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1479965952">11/24/16(Thu)00:39:12</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5740" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5740');" title="Reply to this post">5740</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5740"><a href="#p5739" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5739</a><br>The other thing is, is that /a/ threads simply do not fit into /e/. What I mean by that is people on /a/ don&#039;t act like people on /e/. /e/ lacks the usual 4chan behavior that other boards have. Things like reaction images are commonplace on other boards but on /e/ they aren&#039;t very welcome. I will usually just delete them if they are annoying enough because technically they are against the rules, but that part is not enforced everywhere else because of board culture, I guess. <br><br>Also, almost every /a/ thread that gets moved gets a negative reaction on /e/. They really don&#039;t like them. It&#039;s definitely because of what I explained about the differences in behavior. People /e/ look at these threads and just see shitposting. <br><br>I have a few suggestions to improve this.<br><br>- Mods MUST look through the thread before moving them to /e/. Take what I&#039;ve talked about and the examples and learn what should not be on /e/<br><br>- Provide an indicator to janitors or possibly any user that the thread has been moved. Not only will this help me not get anyone banned for something that wasn&#039;t their fault but it would be extremely helpful if I knew immediately what I was dealing with. <br><br>- Let me view a thread before it gets moved to /e/. I can provide suggestions as to whether or not it would be acceptable for /e/ or if there are any rule breaking posts in it. This could be just pinging me on IRC and showing me the thread or possibly having a system in place that lets me approve of a thread before moving (not likely I know, I&#039;m aware that you guys don&#039;t like to give this kind of thing to janitors)<br><br>Let me know what you think.

Everybody is always super excited for these and theres minimal drama these days aside from uploaders getting mad about chinese rips year after year. The usual.<br><br>3: Number 1 turned into everlasting generals. These include Fumos, Onaholes, and more recently someone decided to turn the Dakimakura threads into a general. In the case of Fumos the thread is pretty much &quot;Blog with your doll&quot;, for Onaholes its &quot;Blog about your dick&quot; and the Dakimakura threads is &quot;Where can I buy this / Will I get arrested for buying it&quot;. Also blogging with your pillow wife.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5743"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5743">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5743" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5743">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1479973599">11/24/16(Thu)02:46:39 <a href="#p5743" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5743');" title="Reply to this post">5743</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5743"><input type="checkbox" name="5743" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1479973599">11/24/16(Thu)02:46:39</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5743" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5743');" title="Reply to this post">5743</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5743">Some examples.<br><br>1: Is pretty sad when people just tell them to go to the buyfag thread on /a/.

Alternatively, suggest that they put their claim/excuse of being useful for training new translators to work on /a/-related projects to the test, by having them actually translate things to warrant their existence on /a/. There&#039;s VNTS on /jp/; rationally, why shouldn&#039;t there be an avenue towards LN/manga translation status. In such hypothetical threads, they could still talk about and correct each others&#039; moon skills if they want, because that should be relevant towards whatever lines. It would also be now towards an unambiguously board-related goal that actually should give us prestige and attract a natural competitiveness for quality. If however this idea of strong-arming them into being board relevant just fades into a 1:1 reincarnation of DJT in disguise, then just port them to another board again.

Actually, those threads are a cornerstone of /a/ to probably quite a few, and help to build a unique community. Moving them is counter to some core philosophies that mods seem to approach 4chan with overall; for example /v/ and /co/ have drawthreads too, what happens to them then? In a time of lots of generals and vapid threads I think /a/ needs to cling to any cross-series, cross-thread unifying beacon that exists, incidentally both the threads in question for &gt;3 act as those.<br><br>Buyfag thread is something that, if I recall correctly, basically existed on /toy/. I used to use /toy/ all the time back then mostly for figs and gunpla. However, /toy/ users got annoyed at all the scale figure discussion and at some point, what like 2010-11(?) there was a crackdown to be very strict on no scales, hence buyfag became a thing on /a/. For a time, both /a/ and /jp/ had their own separate buyfag threads. I do believe that (/jp/ sticky, waaambulance) moot&#039;s design was for /jp/ to have basically all buyfag stuff, but clearly, that was never fully implemented/enforced. Clearly under moot&#039;s watch, for many years buyfag on /a/ persisted and people just kind of went with it. More logically, with /jp/ being near-unusable for a lot of that time in those years from spam and turmoil, people just couldn&#039;t be assed trying to have a legit thread there at all as opposed to the nice, stable one on /a/ conveniently nestled between everything else, and it being just not allowed to fully discuss all they wanted to on this subject on /toy/. Now years later /jp/ is stable, but feels pushed around and adamantly doesn&#039;t want to be used as /a/&#039;s junk-filled backyard, not to mention this hostility also would cause further divide between /a/-/jp/ users. If DJT and buyfag were both ported to /jp/ it would near-certain trigger a nasty rejection and those threads might just kind of slip through the cracks and gradually re-coalesce on /a/ even if it took months/years.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5747"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5747">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5747" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5747">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1479984787">11/24/16(Thu)05:53:07 <a href="#p5747" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5747');" title="Reply to this post">5747</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5747"><input type="checkbox" name="5747" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1479984787">11/24/16(Thu)05:53:07</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5747" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5747');" title="Reply to this post">5747</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5747"><a href="#p5746" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5746</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;buyfag cont</span><br><br>So, it is not an easy answer what to do with buyfag. Technically it should be /jp/ but, for the thread to not just get shitposted to death there (which could result in it clawing its way back into /a/ or forcibly bending the rules on /toy/) it would take a very thorough explanation of why the thread was on /a/ all this time and why it looks like a good time to move it now. Out of all the things up for review on /a/ though, I find it much easier to rationalize scooting DJT away than buyfag. /jp/ already has functionally two buyfag threads more relevant directly to the board&#039;s interests, and /toy/ has threads about nendoroids and figma, which also cross over into the /a/ buyfag threads. So /a/ buyfag is mostly about scale figures, however the vast majority of scales are not directly /jp/ material and you better believe that people on /jp/ would object to being forced to support /a/ related things with no bearing to their local board state. Basically, because /jp/ and /a/ are not freely compatible it is just plain not feasible without making needless drama. <br><br>/a/ has been hit over the head with changes lately but /jp/ has not; they won&#039;t care what mods are trying to do on /a/ or how much it helps /a/ or not to support some transplanted /a/ threads. /jp/ itself would need a purposeful sculpting/policy change for a closer /a/ bridge for these schemes to work out well, I suspect. So the question is, why throw two boards into turmoil etc. Entropy wins in the case of buyfag (it stays imo) due to it being pigeonholed between a rock and a hard place regarding past impracticality of trying to run it on /jp/ and /toy/&#039;s rulings, unless there was mutual agreement between the two boards it should be /jp/, of which one if not both sides handily reject.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5748"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5748">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5748" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5748">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1479986241">11/24/16(Thu)06:17:21 <a href="#p5748" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5748');" title="Reply to this post">5748</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5748"><input type="checkbox" name="5748" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1479986241">11/24/16(Thu)06:17:21</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5748" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5748');" title="Reply to this post">5748</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5748">I&#039;ve always thought that boards like /c/ and /e/ could be more than just image dumps.<br><br>That they could house more conversation without ruining anything.

Addressing the /a/-related issues in the OP specifically:<br><br>Buyfag: The buyfag thread would be explicitly on-topic in /jp/ (figures and other otaku paraphernalia).

I&#039;m not sure if anyone else has ever said that, but I&#039;ve said it. The topics are mostly otaku media of various kinds, with &quot;diverse niche Japanese interests&quot; tacked onto the end. The learning of the language arguably falls into neither of these categories. It turns out that learning Japanese is critically important for appreciating a huge swath of otaku media, and most dedicated otaku are in various stages of learning the language, which is why threads about the language often end up... overlooked. I feel the argument that they&#039;re not &quot;actually on-topic&quot; is slightly more convincing than the argument that they are.<br><br>tl;dr - not convinced that buyfag should be kicked of /a/, not in favor of moving DJT to /jp/ (primarily for the reason that it&#039;s a clubhouse more than anything else). Buyfag makes considerably more sense in /jp/ than DJT, but if either or both were officially designated /jp/ material we&#039;d deal with it.<br><br><a href="#p5743" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5743</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;I suppose the alternative to generals is everlasting questions</span><br>They can&#039;t all be winners.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5755"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5755">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5755" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5755">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1479996313">11/24/16(Thu)09:05:13 <a href="#p5755" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5755');" title="Reply to this post">5755</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5755"><input type="checkbox" name="5755" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1479996313">11/24/16(Thu)09:05:13</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5755" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5755');" title="Reply to this post">5755</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f5755"><div class="fileText" id="fT5755">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1479996313747.jpg" target="_blank">1379008757909.jpg</a> (80 KB, 400x557)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1479996313747.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1479996313747s.jpg" alt="80 KB" data-md5="DlD6V94LK0Awza8LLnUIAw==" style="height: 125px; width: 89px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">80 KB JPG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5755">New mod joining the conversation.<br><br><a href="#p5748" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5748</a><br>There are no real rules against conversation in /c/ or /e/.

Aside from a brief meta-derail about the crackdown, it was a solid, on-topic thread.<br><br>What I&#039;m getting at here is that &quot;relocating&quot; /djt/ might not be something that&#039;s necessary at all. If the issue from the beginning is the general format, the insular circlejerk community occupying it and the frequent presence of off-topic discussion, then the solution to me seems to be simply removing /djt/ entirely instead of relocating it. The participants, without their general, will still make threads on /a/ about learning japanese, but as long as those threads are focally on-topic (eg. about anime and manga) and don&#039;t take the form of a successive daily thread (eg. a general), I don&#039;t think they would be inherently bad. Rather, it would be up to us to maintain the diligence to ensure they don&#039;t simply reform the general under a new name. Without the general and its subculture, /a/&#039;s japanese-learners will naturally fall back into line with the rest of the board. If they find that, and our moderation, too restrictive, they&#039;ll relocate on their own to a more suitable board. To me, the principle issue seems to lie with the stagnant general and it&#039;s rigid format having a stranglehold on all of /a/ discussion pertaining to learning japanese, not necessarily with its users.<br><br><br>I don&#039;t think the users that constitute /djt/ would fit in to the culture of another board, and all relocating is likely to accomplish is create a diaspora that butts heads with its new host board for a few weeks before its users trickle back to /a/ and leave a new general with some 20 active users reserving a spot on their host board 24/7. That&#039;s not really solving the problem, it&#039;s just making new problems for other boards.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5766"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5766">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5766" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5766">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1480025423">11/24/16(Thu)17:10:23 <a href="#p5766" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5766');" title="Reply to this post">5766</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5766"><input type="checkbox" name="5766" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1480025423">11/24/16(Thu)17:10:23</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5766" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5766');" title="Reply to this post">5766</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5766"><a href="#p5765" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5765</a><br>I think these same issues of stagnating subculture and rigid format plague most of the other generals on /a/, but they might not be as easy to deal with. Drawfag threads can&#039;t have their share of problems but I can&#039;t really see any way that meddling from the moderation will actually improve their situation. At best we just chase drawfags away. Rather, I think the best approach here is a wait and see, and hopefully positive changes made to the rest of the board will result in positive changes to the frequent users of drawfag threads.<br><br>As for buyfag threads; I don&#039;t think relocation would be appropriate, because I think there would be the same inevitable culture clash between /a/ buyfags and /toy/ users that would benefit nobody. Rather, I think since the merchandising of anime series is so intrinsically linked to the rest of the franchise continuum, it&#039;s probably appropriate to consider it provisionally on-topic so long as discussion remains focused on merchandise for anime and manga, and not on onaholes or some other japanese merchandise that isn&#039;t directly /a/-related. <br><br>I think it could be dealt with either in the same manner as I suggested for /djt/ above, simply targeting the general itself but not the topic, and allowing users to continue to talk about buyfaggotry on the condition that they avoid successive or regularly scheduled threads and abide by the set of suggestions from the OP. The other alternate, I think, would be to simply limit the general to 1 thread a week, or something similar.<br><br>Speaking of limiting, I would also like to see Jojo and One Piece threads limited much in the same manner. We did this previously for &quot;big 3&quot; manga and it seemed to be an effective compromise to both permit them to discuss there series in line with the constant flow of new content, while also limiting their presence on the board and avoiding an extremely low-quality general, which is what both these threads have become.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5767"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5767">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5767" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5767">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1480026608">11/24/16(Thu)17:30:08 <a href="#p5767" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5767');" title="Reply to this post">5767</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5767"><input type="checkbox" name="5767" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1480026608">11/24/16(Thu)17:30:08</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5767" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5767');" title="Reply to this post">5767</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5767"><a href="#p5766" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5766</a><br>As for /c/ and /e/ threads:<br>I don&#039;t think relocating most of these threads to /c/ or /e/ is really necessary. In general, I think relocating should be saved for times when the thread itself is of high-quality such that it is worth preserving instead of deleting. Most of the time we address threads of that nature on /a/, they aren&#039;t particularly high-quality or deserving of being moved. The people who make and participate in those threads are also definitely aware of the fact that more appropriate boards exist for them to be posted. They aren&#039;t ignorant or forgetful of the fact that those boards exist. They just choose to make their thread on /a/ regardless of that. In that sense, I don&#039;t think moving the thread accomplishes anything except place a mediocre imagedump on a slow board.They post those threads on /a/ because they want to talk about and discuss butts or armpits or how cute X character is with /a/. In the cases where these threads are low-quality or off-topic enough to require action from the moderation team, deletion or a warning for either GR3 or /a/1 would probably suffice, and escalated further if they insist on reposting it. If any more concrete of a message needs to be communicated, /trash/ is probably the most suitable board to relocate those sorts of threads to. As far as I know, that&#039;s why that board was made.<br><br>The last things I want to address is:<br>The monmusu general, which I think should probably be addressed by being limited to around the release of new content. It&#039;s a case of a thread where quality fluctuates greatly depending on whether there&#039;s actual content to discuss and has no need for an omnipresent general reserving space for discussion during the long periods where there&#039;s simply nothing to discuss.<br><br>The other I want to address is the KanColle general.

They&#039;re boards within boards. There are a lot of people who come to a board specifically for one general thread. People treat their own generals as their own, separate boards, with their own &quot;culture&quot; - quirks, memes, (in)famous posters, drama, rivalries, etc.<br><br>Normally, it&#039;s not really that big of a deal. People are allowed to like what they like and ignore what they don&#039;t like. It&#039;s fine if they seek out only some threads and don&#039;t care about others. But the problem is, 4chan threads are by design temporary. They exist for a certain amount of time/posts, and when their time is up, they die and leave room for other threads. So when you have people treat their threads as their boards, &quot;their home&quot;, they want to keep those threads alive, even if they have nothing to discuss. We&#039;ve all seen people make threads with OPs like &quot;No X thread up? Time to make one!&quot;, it&#039;s that kind of mentality.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5777"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5777">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5777" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5777">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1480072592">11/25/16(Fri)06:16:32 <a href="#p5777" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5777');" title="Reply to this post">5777</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5777"><input type="checkbox" name="5777" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1480072592">11/25/16(Fri)06:16:32</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5777" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5777');" title="Reply to this post">5777</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5777"><a href="#p5776" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5776</a><br>Post too long, rest of the post here:<br><br>/a/ isn&#039;t as fast as the fastest boards, but it&#039;s still pretty fast. If a thread gets no replies within two hours, it dies. People obviously want to avoid that, so they keep bumping them. When a general thread has been running for years, all possible discussion on it has long since been exhausted, and discussion about new content is quickly exhausted after that new content is released. People can&#039;t bump their generals with on-topic discussion since they&#039;ve already discussed everything worth discussing a long time ago. So, to keep their threads alive, they start posting bad content - posting coypastas, reposting memes, reposting images, posting controversial statements to bait others into replying, stirring drama by shit talking some recognizable thread regulars or posting stuff they know that other guy hates, etc.<br><br>I don&#039;t see a way to avoid this from happening when a thread is supposed to be up 24/7. I know it&#039;s not a perfect solution, but I think the quality of those threads would be greatly improved if they were limited to, say, one thread a week. There are some pseudo-generals (X Monday, Y Tuesday, Z Wednesday, etc.) that already work that way, and although admittedly these threads are far from perfect, they&#039;re in a much better state than they would be if they were up 24/7.<br><br>If you were only allowed to have one thread a week, you would have plenty of time to &quot;recharge&quot;, to come up with new stuff you want to talk about, to come up with new silly jokes or other OC stuff to post in the thread etc. - and the same would apply for all the other regulars of that general. So instead of having your general have ten threads spread over the week with 4800 reposts and 200 original posts, you would have one thread a week with 200 original posts and 300 reposts.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5778"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5778">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5778" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5778">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1480073683">11/25/16(Fri)06:34:43 <a href="#p5778" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5778');" title="Reply to this post">5778</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5778"><input type="checkbox" name="5778" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1480073683">11/25/16(Fri)06:34:43</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5778" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5778');" title="Reply to this post">5778</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5778"><a href="#p5771" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;5771</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;Moving bad /a/ threads onto /c/ doesn&#039;t help either party.

While it&#039;s not bad to have a community, 4chan is supposed to be ephemeral by nature.<br>Users may need to be reminded it&#039;s okay to not post, you should report rule breaking, and 4chan is only as much fun as you put into it.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc5782"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa5782">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p5782" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim5782">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1480121148">11/25/16(Fri)19:45:48 <a href="#p5782" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5782');" title="Reply to this post">5782</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi5782"><input type="checkbox" name="5782" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1480121148">11/25/16(Fri)19:45:48</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p5782" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('5782');" title="Reply to this post">5782</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f5782"><div class="fileText" id="fT5782">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1480121148989.jpg" target="_blank">20161126_so_miku_was_mai_waifu.jpg</a> (2.38 MB, 3264x1836)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1480121148989.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1480121148989s.jpg" alt="2.38 MB" data-md5="YalbpTPthGjB92OZ/lRxaw==" style="height: 70px; width: 125px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">2.38 MB JPG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m5782">I was actually present in the irc when /djt/ was moved to /int/.

In the example of LN translations that simply cannot be found with google, the only way a user would find it by lurking is if they asked for it, and some pitiful soul decided to post the link.

If at any point you feel that you, as a janitor, lack the knowledge or background of some aspect of a board to take action, then the appropriate action is to do nothing or bring the issue to another member of the team. Even with a clear set of guidelines, acting without fully understanding the context of what it is you&#039;re acting on can cause problems all around.

It&#039;s better to trouble another janitor or a mod for their 2 cents on an issue than trouble the entire board with a bad call.<br><br>Not to accuse you of ever doing anything like that, but I just feel that, given the current circumstances, it&#039;s important to remind people that we are a team.

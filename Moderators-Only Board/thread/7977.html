it&#039;s clear that people want a place to say is on their mind, but also feel like the current avenues for this (/b/, /r9k/, [s4s], /bant/, /qa/) aren&#039;t good enough. And I get it. Those boards are actually used for a pretty narrow set of things: /b/ is for porn, /r9k/ for relationships, [s4s] and /bant/ for... whatever it is they do, and /qa/ for schizoposting. So if you make a thread unrelated to what&#039;s popular there, it&#039;s not going to get replies. If there were a genuinely good board for discussing any random thing, I&#039;m sure most off topic reports would disappear. The question is, do you think it&#039;s possible?<br><br>I think most importantly here, it has to be SFW. But to prevent it from becoming like /qa/, there would also have to be some level of quality control. And this is the hard part. No one wants to post on a board that&#039;s 90% basedjaks, but how do you stop it? Would you just ban basedjaks? Maybe in the short term it works, but people will find something else to force, and you can&#039;t just keep adding new stuff to the blacklist. But you know, basedjaks and schizoposting already count as rule 6 violations, so without even changing any rules or making a new board, we could clean /qa/ up so that people are incentivized to post there instead of making off-topic posts all across the site. Just get a few janitors willing to enforce this and the other global rules, and it should be fine.<br><br>What do you think? A lot of people dislike /qa/ because there&#039;s almost nothing but schizo spam, but if we clean it up by applying global rules 6 and 10 a bit more actively, I&#039;m sure it would gain new life and give anons something they clearly want, which is a place to freely discuss whatever they want without getting drowned in porn and spam.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7978"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7978">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7978" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7978">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1624661076">06/25/21(Fri)18:44:36 <a href="#p7978" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7978');" title="Reply to this post">7978</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7978"><input type="checkbox" name="7978" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #800080'>Anonymous ## Mod</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1624661076">06/25/21(Fri)18:44:36</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7978" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7978');" title="Reply to this post">7978</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7978"><a href="#p7977" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7977</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;If there were a genuinely good board for discussing any random thing, I&#039;m sure most off topic reports would disappear.</span><br>lol<br><br>anyway, i&#039;ve cleaned up the schizo spam on /qa/ on and off for months now. there are a few dedicated shitposters who use proxies and do not seem like they are going anywhere any time soon. if i camp the board 24/7, then i can keep it clean, but really, it&#039;s /qa/. who wants to do that? especially when there are so many other boards that are constantly in need of help<br><br>i&#039;m not opposed to your idea really, but unfortunately i just don&#039;t think it&#039;s realistic with the tools we currently have available</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7979"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7979">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7979" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7979">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1624663947">06/25/21(Fri)19:32:27 <a href="#p7979" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7979');" title="Reply to this post">7979</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7979"><input type="checkbox" name="7979" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1624663947">06/25/21(Fri)19:32:27</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7979" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7979');" title="Reply to this post">7979</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f7979"><div class="fileText" id="fT7979">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1624663947954.gif" target="_blank">thinkspin.gif</a> (30 KB, 128x128)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1624663947954.gif" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1624663947954s.jpg" alt="30 KB" data-md5="WHdjPluutJmKrhvDfsDF8A==" style="height: 125px; width: 125px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">30 KB GIF</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7979"><a href="#p7977" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7977</a><br>[s4s] is basically old silly /b/, by that virtue I personally think it has value.

Like a user can go to the Feedback (or something else) page, select Q&amp;A in the category with some other options like if it&#039;s a general question or a board specific question and hopefully a mod (or even a janny if they knows a lot about the subject and gets approved by a mod in some way) will reply to it.

And I get it. Those boards are actually used for a pretty narrow set of things: /b/ is for porn, /r9k/ for relationships, [s4s] and /bant/ for... whatever it is they do, and /qa/ for schizoposting. So if you make a thread unrelated to what&#039;s popular there, it&#039;s not going to get replies.

The question is, do you think it&#039;s possible?</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;I think most importantly here, it has to be SFW. But to prevent it from becoming like /qa/, there would also have to be some level of quality control. And this is the hard part. No one wants to post on a board that&#039;s 90% basedjaks, but how do you stop it? Would you just ban basedjaks? Maybe in the short term it works, but people will find something else to force, and you can&#039;t just keep adding new stuff to the blacklist. But you know, basedjaks and schizoposting already count as rule 6 violations, so without even changing any rules or making a new board, we could clean /qa/ up so that people are incentivized to post there instead of making off-topic posts all across the site. Just get a few janitors willing to enforce this and the other global rules, and it should be fine.</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;What do you think? A lot of people dislike /qa/ because there&#039;s almost nothing but schizo spam, but if we clean it up by applying global rules 6 and 10 a bit more actively, I&#039;m sure it would gain new life and give anons something they clearly want, which is a place to freely discuss whatever they want without getting drowned in porn and spam.</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><br><span class="quote">&gt; Anonymous ## Mod 06/25/21(Fri)18:44:36 No.7978▶<a href="#p7979" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7979</a> <a href="#p7982" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7982</a></span><br><span class="quote">&gt;<a href="#p7977" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7977</a> (OP)</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;&gt;If there were a genuinely good board for discussing any random thing, I&#039;m sure most off topic reports would disappear.</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;lol</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;anyway, i&#039;ve cleaned up the schizo spam on /qa/ on and off for months now. there are a few dedicated shitposters who use proxies and do not seem like they are going anywhere any time soon. if i camp the board 24/7, then i can keep it clean, but really, it&#039;s /qa/. who wants to do that? especially when there are so many other boards that are constantly in need of help</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;i&#039;m not opposed to your idea really, but unfortunately i just don&#039;t think it&#039;s realistic with the tools we currently have available</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><br><span class="quote">&gt; Anonymous ## Janitor 06/25/21(Fri)19:32:27 No.7979▶<a href="#p7981" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7981</a> <a href="#p7983" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7983</a></span><br><span class="quote">&gt;File: thinkspin.gif (30 KB, 128x128)</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;<a href="#p7977" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7977</a> (OP)</span><br><span class="quote">&gt;[s4s] is basically old silly /b/, by that virtue I personally think it has value.

The way I see it, the problem isn&#039;t that there aren&#039;t enough places for anons to discuss their off topic subjects, it&#039;s that they only want to discuss certain off topic things with users from a particular board.<br>For example, threads are frequently made on /fit/ asking for advice with women, and these are usually deleted or moved to /adv/ which is a more appropriate board for the subject. I&#039;m sure some of the people making these threads didn&#039;t even know there was such a board as /adv/ and understand why their thread gets moved, but many are likely aware of that fact and yet still specifically want the advice of people that use /fit/, not the people that go on /adv/.<br><br>On the matter of /qa/ I personally think the whole idea is just ineffective. The 4chan userbase is far more fragmented than almost any other forum I&#039;ve seen so making a meta thread on /qa/ to discuss a certain board won&#039;t actually result in many people who frequent that board seeing the thread. From this perspective I can definitely understand why so many people liked the &quot;one meta thread per board&quot; rule that we had for a short amount of time, since at least that way you could discuss meta with people who actually had something to say.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7998"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7998">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7998" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7998">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1625015177">06/29/21(Tue)21:06:17 <a href="#p7998" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7998');" title="Reply to this post">7998</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7998"><input type="checkbox" name="7998" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1625015177">06/29/21(Tue)21:06:17</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7998" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7998');" title="Reply to this post">7998</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7998"><a href="#p7991" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7991</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;SFW /r9k/</span><br>That&#039;s just /adv/.<br><span class="quote">&gt;SFW /soc/</span><br>There&#039;s already a ton of &quot;Clean&quot; threads there and many more where you can &quot;make friends without being inundated with genitals&quot;. /soc/ might be a trash pile of cock selfies but with some filter work (or not giving a shit) you can just use it for whatever it is you&#039;re going there for.<br><br><a href="#p7977" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7977</a><br>You could not pay me to regularly use /qa/, I only go there to discuss meta occasionally and that&#039;s it. On the other hand I like using /bant/ since it&#039;s one of the few places on the website where you can actually funpost. Similarly, you could not make me use /b/ no matter how non-shit it suddenly became; I could not care and likely would never even know such a thing happened as a user thus nullifying all the effort put into such an initiative which would only &quot;benefit&quot; those who already use it (if not just shit on them since people will likely get banned in order to achieve this).<br>And no, it won&#039;t gain new life because just as it has been pointed out, anons who make Off-Topic posts like to make them on THEIR boards, hence why Off-Topic meta varies from board to board and finding some trash can where you can dump threads doesn&#039;t actually convince people to make them there (which is what happens with /pol/ -&gt; /bant/ moves for the past 3 years).<br>There&#039;s been several attempts by Mods to change /b/ and it all crumbles once they stop enforcing their lawful evil tyranny on them; and that&#039;s a good thing. It means that the random boards are actually random and that their users have a say on the topics. In my opinion you should leave these places as they are; they&#039;re that way for a reason. No amount of heavy handed moderation will achieve good results and 4chan as a whole is better off if you focus on actually rule breaking posts.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7999"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7999">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7999" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7999">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1625020242">06/29/21(Tue)22:30:42 <a href="#p7999" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7999');" title="Reply to this post">7999</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7999"><input type="checkbox" name="7999" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1625020242">06/29/21(Tue)22:30:42</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7999" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7999');" title="Reply to this post">7999</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7999"><a href="#p7998" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7998</a><br><span class="quote">&gt;You could not pay me to regularly use /qa/</span><br>everyone has a price</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc8000"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa8000">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p8000" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim8000">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1625056803">06/30/21(Wed)08:40:03 <a href="#p8000" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8000');" title="Reply to this post">8000</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi8000"><input type="checkbox" name="8000" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1625056803">06/30/21(Wed)08:40:03</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p8000" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8000');" title="Reply to this post">8000</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m8000"><a href="#p7998" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7998</a><br>Good post.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc8001"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa8001">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p8001" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim8001">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1625148142">07/01/21(Thu)10:02:22 <a href="#p8001" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8001');" title="Reply to this post">8001</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi8001"><input type="checkbox" name="8001" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1625148142">07/01/21(Thu)10:02:22</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p8001" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8001');" title="Reply to this post">8001</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f8001"><div class="fileText" id="fT8001">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1625148142511.jpg" target="_blank">I don&#039;t money.jpg</a> (74 KB, 640x720)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1625148142511.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1625148142511s.jpg" alt="74 KB" data-md5="5lU0p4imonEKBzbJ2O3OIw==" style="height: 125px;

But one thing you fail to understand is the old /b/ existed in a different time in the internet. <br><br>Today, the millennials who enjoyed 14 year old internet shitposting back in 2005-2010 are grown up. They can barely be bothered to venture away from Facebook and twitter anymore. <br><br>Why? because this is by design. The big social media companies used the mobile phone internet revolution to hijack the internet and mold it into what it is today. <br><br>Part of the reason, in my opinion, 4chan has suffered lately is because of these ridiculous captchas. There&#039;s been so many times when I access 4chan from my safari on my iPhone and try to make a good comment or participate in quality conversations but the insane sliding captchas are just soooo off-putting. The first time I get a &quot;captcha incorrect&quot; message after trying to type that long weird bullshit I just abandon the comment altogether. Are these captchas really necessary? Are they really better than standard recaptchas? have standard recaptchas been beaten by bots? They seem to be used everywhere else in the world so I tend to think not... <br><br>In fact, 4chan is the only website I&#039;ve ever come across that uses these insanely difficult captchas. <br><br>You know who doesn&#039;t? Facebook, reddit, twitter, and all these other platforms that have taken over the internet. They actively encourage posting whereas 4chan actively makes it more difficult, leaving only the most dedicated trolls and shitposters left. No longer are there casual 4chan posters, the new captcha has weeded them out. All that&#039;s left are the bottom of the barrel posters who post the SAME &quot;celeb&quot; thread 10000x a day. <br><br>When did /b/ become a place to spam SFW pictures of celebrities from social media?

It baffles me. <br><br>One thing to understand is that internet usage has shifted in the last 15 years. We live in an age where if an article isn&#039;t in pictures or bullet points we literally cant read it. <br><br>We live in an age where if a video buffers for more than literally 1 second we just hit the back button and move on. This affliction of INSTANT-gratification (and i mean INSTANT) effects millions if not billions of people. Shit, I am 30 and I admit to being affected by this too. Which contributes to why it&#039;s so bothersome to perform the new captchas just to participate in a conversation that likely will receive no response. <br><br>Modern day 4chan doesn&#039;t fit the new-age instant gratification model that the big social media companies have created. <br><br>1. It sucks on mobile. <br>2. Posting is hard because captchas are hard<br>3. You only accept bitcoin for 4chan gold so its inaccessible to millions of people who would&#039;ve otherwise paid with a card<br>4. Even when posting a high quality response or comment, there&#039;s like a 99% chance no one will even respond to you, so there is no &quot;social&quot; media aspect to 4chan. <br>I&#039;m not saying all this is bad. I&#039;m saying this is a major contributor to why 4chan and /b/ is the way it is now. <br><br>I love 4chan, it is truly the last beacon of free speech. The last place where I can speak my mind, tell the truth, confess secrets, and yes, view fringe porn. But the current state of /b/ is a product of the world we live in and its incompatibility with mobile-addicted instant gratification conversationalists.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc8858"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa8858">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p8858" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim8858">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1670075830">12/03/22(Sat)08:57:10 <a href="#p8858" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8858');" title="Reply to this post">8858</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi8858"><input type="checkbox" name="8858" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1670075830">12/03/22(Sat)08:57:10</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p8858" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8858');" title="Reply to this post">8858</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m8858">I agree that the current sliding mechanism of the captchas doesn&#039;t play nice with some touch-based browser interfaces.

and some of the various issues it has, old and new. One relatively new issue that&#039;s been bothering me a bit is a recent increase in &quot;jews!&quot;/stormfront bait threads. I guess they&#039;re not far from the type of posts you&#039;d find on /b/ or /pol/ (or maybe /q/ haha). Threads like this, <br><br>http://archive.foolz.us/tv/thread/3<wbr>6954172/<br>http://archive.foolz.us/tv/thread/3<wbr>6946295/<br>http://archive.foolz.us/tv/thread/3<wbr>6955118/<br><br>Now you cant really escape from big issues like race on /tv/, whether its a major theme of a particular film i.e. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544<wbr>/ (you should go watch that btw) or some industry related thing like a Mel Gibson meltdown, its a fairly inclusive place. But the sort of threads I linked are, in my opinion, getting pushed and just made to stir up trouble.<br><br>I mean this thread http://archive.foolz.us/tv/thread/3<wbr>6946295/ has fostered some ontopic disussion that isnt all terrible, but most of it is pretty racist and bad. Iirc Ive seen this thread with that image reposted a dozen or so times over the past 6 months or so, maybe more.<br> <br>It would be nice I hope if the /tv/ janitors (I think there are about 4 including me) and the mods who frequent /tv/ could share their opinions on threads like the ones above. Like what sort of approach they take if they see a thread or post like that that gets reported?<br><br>On the whole I think I take a pretty laid back approach and adopt a &quot;Take It Easy&quot; policy in general. &quot;Television &amp; Film&quot; is a pretty broad topic, but it does annoy me when certain contentious themes/issues are needlessly getting pushed with the same or very similar &quot;low content&quot; threads. So maybe we could use a thread here to bounce around a few ideas/opinions. Anyway, other hot topics for discussion should probably be<br><br>-Those thinly disguised actress threads that lead to posts about feet and if they look fuckable<br>-Repost threads <br>-A recent increase in pornstar/actress threads. http://archive.foolz.us/tv/thread/3<wbr>6789013/</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc3217"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa3217">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p3217" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim3217">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1379170471">09/14/13(Sat)10:54 <a href="#p3217" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3217');" title="Reply to this post">3217</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi3217"><input type="checkbox" name="3217" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1379170471">09/14/13(Sat)10:54</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p3217" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('3217');" title="Reply to this post">3217</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3217">Foolz is down for me right now, but I&#039;ve got a good idea as to the /pol/ threads you&#039;re talking about.

It started because of Mark Wahlberg&#039;s &quot;VIETNAM FUCKING SHITS&quot; outburst. Those threads usually die within 10 or so replies, seem harmless to me.<br><br>Most of this stuff has been around on /tv/ way before /pol/ was around. Most of its a joke. Unless I KNOW it&#039;s a pol thread, like I just saw the exact same thread on pol, or it has nothing to do with television &amp; film, then I&#039;ll leave it alone. <br><br><span class="quote">&gt;Take it easy approach</span><br>Best course of action imo<br><br>The actress and waifu threads you brought up are much worse for the board. They clog up the board, and often infect other threads. Because just about every movie or show has an attractive female actress in them, the waifuists are everywhere. People still spam threads of those teenage (or younger) girls from Nickelodeon, Disney, etc. That is the real problem, and has been for a long time, with /tv/. I think people to go /tv/ to discuss what they just watched on tv, in the cinema, etc. Maybe joke around about it a bit, put a 4chan spin on it. /tv/ is not supposed to be about how if you freeze the latest episode of Mad Men just right you can see up the skirt of Don Draper&#039;s 10 year old daughter.</blockquote></div></div></div><hr><div class="navLinks navLinksBot desktop">[<a href="/j/" accesskey="a">Return</a>] [<a href="/j/catalog">Catalog</a>] [<a href="#top">Top</a>] </div><hr class="desktop"><div class="mobile center"><a class="mobilePostFormToggle button" href="#">Post a Reply</a></div></div><div class="navLinks mobile"><span class="mobileib button"><a href="/j/" accesskey="a">Return</a></span> <span class="mobileib button"><a href="/j/catalog">Catalog</a></span> <span class="mobileib button"><a href="#top">Top</a></span> <span class="mobileib button"><a href="#bottom_r" id="refresh_bottom">Refresh</a></span></div><hr class="mobile"><div class="bottomCtrl desktop"><span class="deleteform"><input type="hidden" name="mode" value="usrdel">Delete Post:<input type="hidden" name="res" value="3214"> [<input type="checkbox" name="onlyimgdel" value="on">File Only]<input type="hidden" id="delPassword" name="pwd"> <input type="submit" value="Delete"><input id="bottomReportBtn" type="button" value="Report"></span></div></form><div id="absbot" class="absBotText"><div class="mobile"><span id="disable-mobile">[<a href="javascript:disableMobile();">Disable Mobile View / Use Desktop Site</a>]<br><br></span><span id="enable-mobile">[<a href="javascript:enableMobile();">Enable Mobile View / Use Mobile Site</a>]<br><br></span></div><span class="absBotDisclaimer">All trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective parties.

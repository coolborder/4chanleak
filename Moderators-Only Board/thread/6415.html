It would be nice if there were some sort of objective, simple, one-size fits all solution that could fix up the board generally and improve the experience for everyone. Some of the topic threads that surpass the month cutoff are nearing the standard 300 post limit to the point that they&#039;re not liable to be particularly harmed by by instituting a hard cutoff. I think as a &quot;starting point&quot; it&#039;s a safe enough one. <br><br>Still, I&#039;d remain worried about the state of the front page. If I had to design a wishlist one-board solution I feel like at some point there should just be measures by which general threads and non-general threads are formally treated differently. 2ch-type and 2chan-type threads have very different heritage and institutionalizing the difference could go a long way in improving the flow of the board. For example, maybe general threads would only bump every so often (so they aren&#039;t permanently pasted to page 1 until they hit bump limit), but would also be able to dodge the two-week MfD cutoff (so that more niche topics could stay alive.) Users could set the flag on thread creation and staff could modify it if necessary.<br><br>Having a custom feature like that would be a pipe dream but I think it would go a long way in making /jp/ look more like a normal board.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc6437"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa6437">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p6437" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim6437">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1509327422">10/29/17(Sun)21:37:02 <a href="#p6437" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('6437');" title="Reply to this post">6437</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi6437"><input type="checkbox" name="6437" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1509327422">10/29/17(Sun)21:37:02</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p6437" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('6437');" title="Reply to this post">6437</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m6437"><a href="#p6435" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;6435</a><br>I realized that I&#039;m sort of fixated on these &quot;custom solutions&quot; but I really do think that the front page is not going to change at all without one. Even if /jp/sies made TWICE as many threads as before, twice zero non-Touhou threads a day is still zero. /jp/sies just don&#039;t make threads. If you want them made either there has to be some massive concerted internal push for it or you&#039;re going to have to get them from elsewhere.<br><br>This sort of runs headfirst into a sort of delicate issue around the way that /jp/ is moderated, but I think it is the case that a lot of users from elsewhere get massive culture and rules shock both when they come to /jp/ for the first time and immediately turn around and go home. The overall &quot;level of enforcement&quot; in /jp/ is significantly higher than in a lot of other boards and users who run into it turn around and try to sneak their topics back into /a/ or /v/ (or wherever the quasi-/jp/ topic is being discussed) rather than trying to adapt to /jp/, after which the &quot;my friends are here&quot; effect kicks in and keeps them out of /jp/ indefinitely. <br><br>For example, there&#039;s a FSN thread up right now, <a href="/a/catalog#s=164071590%2C" class="quotelink"><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/a/164071590</span>,</a> that could easily be a /jp/ thread based solely on the topic but if it were in /jp/ I could see a fifth of those posts being axed and the people who made them warned/banned for making shitty posts, and it sometimes happens that way in practice when threads are moved to /jp/. I&#039;m happy to table enforcement issues for now in favor of structural issues concerning generals / non-generals in /jp/ but if I had to draft a list of reasons why people keep forcing /jp/ topics into other boards I think that it&#039;s a factor that needs to be listed alongside &quot;my friends are here&quot; and /jp/&#039;s reputation as 3D idol autism hell and the like. Anyway, that&#039;s the last I&#039;ll say on that particular topic for now.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc6438"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa6438">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p6438" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim6438">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1509333123">10/29/17(Sun)23:12:03 <a href="#p6438" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('6438');" title="Reply to this post">6438</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi6438"><input type="checkbox" name="6438" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1509333123">10/29/17(Sun)23:12:03</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p6438" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('6438');" title="Reply to this post">6438</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m6438">If people want to post silly things in /jp/, that is fine by me.

Is the board more memorable and meaningful for it, though?<br><br>I would say that some of what may be wished for / desired in this conversation is confined to the past. What is desired? A pleasant, very relaxed and open (but vastly storied and experienced) atmosphere, and authentic excitement for the place itself? Such trends may be more of related to when the board still very much felt like an /a/ offshoot in 2008, a time quite different overall from today for not just /jp/ but also /a/ and 4chan as a whole. Subjects that had intermingled on /a/ now had their own place and with that came a prevailing wind of users and common bonds. The wind died down over time, and with it the common bond of the board.<br><br>What we see on /jp/ today with a balkanization into preferred enclaves is now endemic to many boards with lower posting rates 4chan-wide. The longer time it&#039;s been away from /a/ with more cycles of user turnover, the more it&#039;s diverged. Old /jp/ is to me like an exotic, long-extinct fantastic creature of history, like the anomalocarid Aegirocassis benmoulai - heavily derived from its former niche, making a success for itself very different from its contemporaries, utterly spectacular. I look at Touhou threads on current /jp/ but don&#039;t see the progeny of Aegirocassis. Rather, I see in each a Schinderhannes bartelsi - same lineage of creature, but swimming around in a far-future world that has evolved much around it, its very existence a shock from having existed past several extinction events. It&#039;s evolved new features for its lineage, but will never turn back into that Aegirocassis even if you protected them in a private ocean.

They don&#039;t necessarily have to be. Consider the following:<br><br>a.) Given how East/West collaborations have historically been considered more Western than Eastern in nature on 4chan, and that these new holos will possibly be catering more to a much more Western/Twitch-based audience and so on, are they even a proper fit for /jp/?

People even talked about having separate threads/generals for every hololive jp members.<br><br>While some of those threads/generals could perhaps be within our board rules (some of them were clearly just trolling/spamming), I think we should also care about other topics and communities in /jp/ too and I&#039;m sure they wouldn&#039;t like the idea of turning /jp/ into a board where 90% of the threads are vtuber related.<br><br>As for the hololive global thread itself, IMO it can stay at the moment since we can just move it to some other board like /bant/ if it becomes too off-topic for /jp/.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7487"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7487">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7487" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7487">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1600346292">09/17/20(Thu)08:38:12 <a href="#p7487" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7487');" title="Reply to this post">7487</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7487"><input type="checkbox" name="7487" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1600346292">09/17/20(Thu)08:38:12</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7487" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7487');" title="Reply to this post">7487</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7487"><a href="#p7460" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7460</a><br><a href="#p7467" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7467</a><br>And just like I predicted, the second part has also happened over the past week over and over again.

Two weeks ago, we had 0 clue this thing, English-speaking vtubers under the control of one of the largest Japanese companies, was happening so soon. A week ago, we were sure these were going to suck, it&#039;d be a flop and we would move on with our lives, not only that but many were mostly hostile to the idea itself.

People are frequently reporting missing sleep, missing work to watch these things, going into withdrawal when there are no active streams. It&#039;s at a fever pitch.

These new ones are achieving in one week what took other vtubers several years to achieve. Tons of people watching these are newcomers to vtubers themselves; they outright state it when asked, and will start to spread the word/viral them.

The first is that the two hololive threads are a massive presence, accounting for over 90% of the board&#039;s traffic. Whenever a holo thread archives, people attempt to make a new one instantly, and if many people try this at once it can kill off old threads without warning. Combine this with the tendency of posters to leak out and post holos outside of the vtuber threads, or to ignore the board&#039;s etiquette, and this has made some people rather irritated. The second is that there&#039;s only one thread for vtubers outside the big 2 companies, and it&#039;s often filled solely with discussion of VOMS or &quot;groomed indies&quot; to where discussing anything else isn&#039;t really possible. Thus groups that are popular and have fans like Animare or Honey Strap never get discussed because it&#039;s drowned out by something else. And that something is my third reason: infighting. All of these threads are terrible at not taking bait, and get derailed constantly by trolling. Part of this is natural, but having everyone contained in 4 threads to begin with generates friction, so when people start to rub shoulders it gets nasty.<br><br>What my fellow janitor wrote above is true: This stuff burns you out. The 2 slower threads are usually chill, but all four are like combustion engines that can go off at anytime and look like a nuclear reactor failure. A new board may not solve all of it, but it will give some breathing room to the people who genuinely want to discuss vtubers versus the ones who want to partake in /v/ tier shitflinging, as a lot of them want to do. If it does get made, I&#039;d be glad to help keep it clean. There would still be issues to deal with, but the threads on /jp/ are only getting worse, so it&#039;s a change worth contemplating.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7627"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7627">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7627" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7627">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1607481054">12/08/20(Tue)21:30:54 <a href="#p7627" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7627');" title="Reply to this post">7627</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7627"><input type="checkbox" name="7627" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style="color:#aaa">Anonymous</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1607481054">12/08/20(Tue)21:30:54</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7627" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7627');" title="Reply to this post">7627</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f7627"><div class="fileText" id="fT7627">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1607481054670.png" target="_blank">jp1.png</a> (18 KB, 1391x178)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1607481054670.png" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1607481054670s.jpg" alt="18 KB" data-md5="ar5ImxLF7nPRpEieG19wEQ==" style="height: 15px; width: 124px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">18 KB PNG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7627"><a href="#p7625" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7625</a><br>Just to make it clear, this is what happens when no one is there for half an hour.

Simply because no one&#039;s bothering to make threads to replace them; not because 2hu is popular, but rather that there&#039;s literally very little else to discuss on /jp/ that doesn&#039;t have a general already. If you think about it, there being 20 Hololive threads (there&#039;s 53 Hololive idols and not all would have a thread) would not change anything; people would still have nothing else to replace the 20 Hololive threads and the 64 2hu threads with. One topic being more popular than the other also doesn&#039;t impact things, Hololive would be spread out across multiple threads (if the users so choose) and these would be significantly slower than the 2 generals; hence they&#039;ll last a longer time and also help to slow down the 2 big generals.

Vtubers are part of otaku culture as long as they are Japanese (or part of a Japanese company, i.e. HoloEN, ect.) If there were no limit to the number of vtuber threads and /jp/ ended up with a lot of them, it would just be a reflection of how much people want to discuss them. &quot;Otaku culture&quot; is a very broad concept, and limiting the discussion of vtubers to two threads seems to unnecessarily restrict such a popular subject. I&#039;d personally rather have more vtuber threads with quality discussion at the cost of losing a few Touhou-ecchi-image-dump threads.<br><br>This being said, I&#039;m fairly new as well, so it is likely that I do not understand the full scope of the situation.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7641"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7641">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7641" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7641">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1608066084">12/15/20(Tue)16:01:24 <a href="#p7641" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7641');" title="Reply to this post">7641</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7641"><input type="checkbox" name="7641" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1608066084">12/15/20(Tue)16:01:24</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7641" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7641');" title="Reply to this post">7641</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7641">One Another Note:<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/qa/3704808</span><br>Other janitor/mod opinions of this?<br>I can recognize the format predictably, but I&#039;ve generally cleared it for seemingly being relevant to 07th Expansion discussion.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc7643"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa7643">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p7643" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim7643">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1608126063">12/16/20(Wed)08:41:03 <a href="#p7643" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7643');" title="Reply to this post">7643</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi7643"><input type="checkbox" name="7643" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1608126063">12/16/20(Wed)08:41:03</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p7643" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('7643');" title="Reply to this post">7643</a></span></div><div class="file" id="f7643"><div class="fileText" id="fT7643">File: <a href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1608126063388.jpg" target="_blank">1604666659051.jpg</a> (133 KB, 1200x1154)</div><a class="fileThumb" href="//i.4cdn.org/j/v7Wtc0EJILEQFuTo/1608126063388.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="//i.4cdn.org/j/h8x8FnR5iwB4J8q8/1608126063388s.jpg" alt="133 KB" data-md5="+wZ9KkjVvVWIENMX8j7e/g==" style="height: 120px; width: 125px;" loading="lazy"><div data-tip data-tip-cb="mShowFull" class="mFileInfo mobile">133 KB JPG</div></a></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m7643"><a href="#p7641" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;7641</a><br>Seems to me like a bunch of users trying to mob lynch a poster they don&#039;t like.

For the past months I&#039;ve been checking in every so often and just pruning anything unrelated to Hololive, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be genuine interest in a split among those who discuss global in the &quot;main&quot; thread, and whoever makes it goes out of their way to display it isn&#039;t made in good faith. So it just kind of chills in the catalog with an egregious amount of deleted posts if one checks the archive, until either the OP fails to bump before archive or a janny/mod removes it, after which it is simply remade.<br><br>I think it meets the criteria of being a troll thread in that context. However, I am averse to pruning the OP on sight because I don&#039;t want to give off the impression that there is any discretion on making OPs relating to Hololive Global on /jp/, which AFAIK there is no particular stance. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if that&#039;s part of the motivation behind making it as well.<br><br>Not a huge or pressing deal, just want to make sure we&#039;re on the same page and I&#039;m understanding it correctly.</blockquote></div></div><div class="postContainer replyContainer" id="pc8883"><div class="sideArrows" id="sa8883">&gt;&gt;</div><div id="p8883" class="post reply"><div class="postInfoM mobile" id="pim8883">          <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span><br></span><span class="dateTime postNum" data-utc="1670722999">12/10/22(Sat)20:43:19 <a href="#p8883" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8883');" title="Reply to this post">8883</a></span></div><div class="postInfo desktop" id="pi8883"><input type="checkbox" name="8883" value="delete"> <span class="nameBlock"><span class="name" style='color: #4169E1'>Anonymous ## Janitor</span> </span> <span class="dateTime" data-utc="1670722999">12/10/22(Sat)20:43:19</span> <span class="postNum desktop"><a href="#p8883" title="Link to this post">No.</a><a href="javascript:quote('8883');" title="Reply to this post">8883</a></span></div><blockquote class="postMessage" id="m8883"><a href="#p8879" class="quotelink">&gt;&gt;8879</a><br>Personally, unless the OP is violating a rule, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a point in taking it down.
